Hello! 

This Movie Studios Scrape Folder contains tons of information and step by step walkthroughs. Here is what you are about to see:

In chronological order:

1) Using Scrapy to Scrape corresponding websites and info for visualization. See "Scrape Spiders python for Scrapy", they are labeled by movie studio! Inside
each one will be the source website as well as the starting URL.
Initially there was a 403 error, so also see Settings.py to see the User Agent that allowed for a successful connection.

2) Scrapy has a command exclusive to the terminal. It looks like:

scrapy crawl "name of spider"

This command extended yields a unclean csv file. In terminal this looks like:

scrapy crawl "name of spider" -o "name_of_csv".csv

These CSV's were stored in our ----->  1 - Uncleaned CSV From Scrapy

3) Review the IPYNB files in ------> 2 - Cleaning Each Scrape (NOTE these will not run unless you insert the NEW path of our 
uncleaned CSV files. Initially they were in the same directory but for cleanliness all was seperated into it's own unique folder)

As an overview for the above^^^^^^^ Each unclean CSV was reformatted from a df which was once a dictionary of lists. This 
is the format Scrapy scraped from. 

4) Enter the 3- Unclean-->clean Data!! 
All CSV's from 3) (2 - cleaning each scrape) were imported and organized into this folder for our visualization IPYNB!

5) Open visualization IPYNB. This grants insights into some of the weaker movie studios we have based off of there gross
earnings.
